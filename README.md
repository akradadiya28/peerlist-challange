### Day 1 – Animated Avatar Stack
Design and build an animated avatar stack that goes beyond the basics. Think of how avatars can come alive through shapes, colors, gradients, transitions, and motion. Don’t be afraid to break conventions. We’re sharing one example to get you started, but that’s just a spark. Your stack could flip, slide, bounce, fade, or completely reinvent the concept of an avatar group. The only rule: make it fun, creative, and uniquely yours.

How to view:
- Visit `/day-1` in the running app.
